# My Personal Project

## Bank account

**Project description**: This application is a *bank account stimulant* where you deposit money, withdraw money, 
make purchases, you will even receive notifications when your balance reaches a threshold, and you can even go 
bankrupt if your balance goes negative.

**Why is it important**: This project can be used by *everyone* since everyone uses their credit and debit cards 
on a daily basis. Also, as a university student budgeting is a big matter to me and that's why I implemented the
feature where you receive notifications whenever your account balance hits a threshold.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple bank cards.
