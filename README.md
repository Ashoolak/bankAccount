# My Personal Project

## Bank account

**Project description**: This application is a *bank account simulation* where you can add multiple cards, removes cards,
deposit money, withdraw money, and make purchases just like an actual banking app.

**Why is it important**: This project can be used by *everyone* since everyone uses their credit and debit cards 
on a daily basis. I also plan to work in an industry where computer science and finance are hand-to-hand, which made 
the idea of coding a banking app appealing to me.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple bank cards.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove my old cards
- As a user, I want to be able to deposit money into my card
- As a user, I want to be able to withdraw money from my account
- As a user, I want to be able to purchase things using my card
- As a user, I want to see the information associated with my bank card such as the balance
- As a user, I want to be able to save my bank account to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my bank account list from file 

### Phase 4: Task 2

Thu Aug 11 11:12:30 PDT 2022  
Card 1 was added to the account  
Thu Aug 11 11:12:32 PDT 2022  
Card removing attempt failed  
Thu Aug 11 11:12:35 PDT 2022  
Card 1 was removed from account

### Phase 4: Task 3
- Card.purchase and Card.withdraw have the exact same implementation which means I could have factored that out.
- I could have made a separate class for my GUI rather than putting all of the code in my BankApp class which could
improve the readability of my code
