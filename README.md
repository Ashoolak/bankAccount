# My Personal Project

## Bank account

**Project description**: This application is a *bank account simulation* where you can add multiple cards, removes cards,
deposit money, withdraw money, and make purchases just like an actual banking app.

**Why is it important**: This project can be used by *everyone* since everyone uses their credit and debit cards 
on a daily basis. I also plan to work in an industry where computer science and finance are hand-to-hand, which made 
the idea of coding a banking app appealing to me.
